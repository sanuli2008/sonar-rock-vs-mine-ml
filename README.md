# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction 

##  Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end machine learning classification task** that predicts whether an object detected by SONAR signals is a **Rock** or a **Mine**. The model is built using Python and basic machine learning techniques.

This project is implemented by following the YouTube tutorial:
**"Project 1: SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python | End To End Python Machine Learning Project"** by **Siddhardhan**.

The main goal of this project is to understand the **complete ML workflow**, from data loading to model evaluation.

##  Objectives

* Understand and explore the SONAR dataset
* Perform data preprocessing
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Train a machine learning model for classification
* Evaluate the performance of the model

---

##  Dataset Information

* The dataset consists of numerical features extracted from SONAR signals
* Each row represents a signal returned by an object
* Target variable:

  * `R` → Rock
  * `M` → Mine
